# Laravel Attribute Events
ðŸ”¥ Fire events on attribute changes of your Eloquent model

Eloquent models fire several handy events throughout their lifecycle, like `created` and `deleted`. However, there are usually many more interesting events that occur during a model's life. With this library you can add those, by mapping attribute changes of your model to meaningful events.

## Install
```bash
composer require jpkleemans/attribute-events
```

## Usage
Use the `Kleemans\AttributeEvents` trait in your model and add the attributes to the `$dispatchesEvents` property in the form of `'{attribute}:{value}' => '{event}'`:

```php
class Order extends Model
{
    use AttributeEvents;

    protected $dispatchesEvents = [
        'created'         => OrderPlaced::class,
        'status:canceled' => OrderCanceled::class,
        'note:*'          => OrderNoteChanged::class,
        'paid'            => OrderPaid::class,
    ];
}
```

There are three options to define the value of the attribute:
- **Static value**: `attribute:value`  
  Fire when `attribute` changes to `value`
- **Wildcard value**: `attribute:*`  
  Fire when `attribute` changes (to any value)
- **Truthy value**: `attribute`  
  Fire when `attribute` changes to a [truthy](https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php) value

The attribute events will be dispatched after the model is saved. Each event receives the instance of the model through its constructor.

## Accessors (WIP)
For more complex state changes, you can use attributes defined by an [accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#defining-an-accessor):

```php
class Product extends Model
{
    use AttributeEvents;

    protected $dispatchesEvents = [
        'low_stock' => ProductReachedLowStock::class,
    ];

    public function getLowStockAttribute(): bool
    {
        return $this->stock <= 3;
    }
}
```
